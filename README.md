'''Resource management is an important problem for any institution to be more effec-
tive in actions with minimal dynamic changes required. This paper presents an opti-
mization model for managing and allocating resources for wildfire control in the United
States. The model considers the responsibilities of both county and national/federal
agencies and addresses the issue of optimal placement of facilities and resources to
minimize damages caused by wildfires while also being cost-efficient. A local resource
placement strategy is proposed, based on seasonal prediction models, and an integer-
programming technique is used to optimize resource management and allocation within
the states. The proposed interactive model takes into account budget constraints and
provides an optimal resource arrangement that reduces transportation costs. The find-
ings of this study can inform policymakers and wildfire management agencies in their
resource planning and allocation decisions'''
