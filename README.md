""Wildfires"": Wildfires are common across United States (and other countries) with huge loss of natural habitat and an increase in the carbon emission into the atmosphere.
The cause is usually natural, including wind, dryness, lightning etc. There are multiple models out on the web which try to predict these based on historical data. 

While efforts are made to prevent wildfires from happening constantly, without disturbing the ecology of the area, we plan on providing a consumer based solution.
We try to provide strategies, based on various factors affecting the wildfires, to maximize the efficiency in controlling these unfortunate incidents. 

The practices in different states depend on types of vegetation and the topography. Therefore, each state (or a group of them) is required to be looked at separately. 
We try to propose a solution for a few states and hope to help the forest+wildfire department :)
